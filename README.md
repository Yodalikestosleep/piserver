ðŸŸ¥ **This script is intended for clean systems.**  
Running this on an existing setup **will remove Docker containers** if they share names.

1.Clone the repository to your local directory.

```shell
git clone https://github.com/Yodalikestosleep/piserver.git
```

```shell
chmod +x setup_pre.sh setup_post.sh
```

sudo ./setup_pre.sh
```

** make sure to reboot the system after running setup_pre.sh

```shell
sudo ./setup_post.sh
```

You can edit the docker images/volumes according to yourself. This is a simple script to help out automation.

To uninstall the script use:
